# ICE 05: Websockets

This project was completed by group 3: Ceci Herriman, Kelsey Bishqemi, Christopher Yon, and Andreas Keating. 

This application is a group drawing application, allowing anyone connected to the application to draw their own designs along with everyone else connected. Users can choose their own color to draw with, which will reflect on every other user’s screen. 

Our team ran into trouble getting lines working — determining when a user on the client side lifts up on their mouse was difficult, and we did not get it working in time. As a result, lines drawn on a user’s side won’t be identical to those sent to the rest of the users. We also ran into a lot of trouble setting up the demo code and other features that didn’t get finished in time. 

To run the application, run npm run dev and connect to the link provided by vite. We configured our project such that no extra terminal is needed to support web sockets.
